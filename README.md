Design Process

I started designing the website by first making a wireframe in adobe Xd (named as, ID ASG 1 Wireframe in the folder). Then I created the website with reference to the wireframe. Along the way I also improvised slightly and changed a few things. When I first started to code in HTML, I first created the basic structure of the web, the headers, texts, and other information. Then using Google fonts I applied a suitable font in the CSS stylesheet. From there, I selected background colors that I thought would be suitable and look appealing. I ended up with a dark colored background - dark blue/purple, and beige for the secondary background, and white for the text boxes. The text boxes were also styled to be rounder, so that it has a fun look to it.

This project is made to present my resume to other people, like companies that are hiring. As a company that is hiring, I would like to look at a resume that is nicely summarised in a clean and easy manner to read. With this thought in mind, I made the website information short and concise.


Features

Some existing features that helps people smoothly navigate through my website is the navigation bar, which when clicked on brings the user to the requested section.
Another feature is the forms to collect feedback from the user to gather their feedback.

Some ideas I would like to implement, but have not learnt how to, would be to add interactive animations that would bring the user's attention to certain informations.
